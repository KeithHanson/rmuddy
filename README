RMuddy is a Ruby based Triggering system for the MUD client 
Kmuddy (http://www.kmuddy.com). It is essentially an easier,
more powerful way (in my opinion, at least) to create complex
triggering and tracking systems using the KMuddy client.

With RMuddy, you have the flexibility of Ruby, and the ability
to communicate with KMuddy. You'll have commands like:

trigger /regular_expression/, :action

before PluginName, :plugin_action, :hook_action

after PluginName, :plugin_action, :hook_action

send_kmuddy_command("command text")

get_kmuddy_variable("variable_name")

set_kmuddy_variable("variable_name", value)

All of the magic happens inside of the enabled-plugins folder,
which has an included README for you to peruse. The README will
give you a quick run-down of how to use the system and how to 
create your own Plugins.

Currently, the plugins in the enabled-plugins directory are all
written with Achaea in mind (http://www.achaea.com), but they are
all easily adaptible to your MUD of choice. 

Though the author uses the plugins during every MUDing session,
be warned: the state of RMuddy is very volatile. The author is in
no way responsible for the death of your character, dry mana vials,
or any other mishap that may happen from RMuddy crashing or going
haywire.

That being said, Enjoy!
