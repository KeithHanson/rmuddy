This folder is for config.yaml files for each plugin.

The configs should be named the same name as the particular plugin.

So, for instance, a CuringSystem plugin named curing_system.rb should
be named curing_system.yaml. The RMuddy system will then know to 
automatically pick that up and parse it.
